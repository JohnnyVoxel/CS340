SNHU CS340: Client/Server Development

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? 

Creating well commented, modular, reusable code is how I create projects that are maintainable, readable and adaptable. The CRUD module used in this project is a good example of modular code that allows the dashboard to interface with the Mongo Database without having to do it directly. It provides a simple interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents. Even though the initial implementation of the dashboard only utilizes the read function, it can easily be expanded in the future to allow more complex operations.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?  

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I believe the first step is understanding the intended functionality and requirements for the project. Without having a firm grasp on what the end product will entail, the process of getting there will included wasted time and effort. In this project for Grazioso Salvare, my approach differed in creating a CRUD module that included functionality no used in the final project. Initially, this seemed inefficient, but in hindsight I see how that foundation is useful for further development of the dashboard.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?  

As computer scientists we will be finding reliable and creative solutions to various problems. More specifically, we will be responsible for creating and implementing products that fulfill the vision of our clients. We work with those clients to identify the use cases and features.
